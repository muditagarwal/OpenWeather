Thoughts on improving UX And more features that I could add

	- Make location permission optional and if user doesnt want to provide it then ask him to manually enter the city name
	- Integration with Google places for adding a new city for forecast.
	- Manage places (cities) => Add/remove/re-order
	- Consolidated listview to see forecast of all the added cities.
	- show a photo from the city in background, we can fetch this from flickr's geo location api
	- Option to add a new city and all the selected location will be accissble via swiping left and right
	- Animations/background image based on current weather
